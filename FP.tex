   Bom has a list of n favorite numbers which are birthday, driving license, passport number, etc After creating an email account, Bom wants to choose a password as the largest number P among all possible numbers generated by the combinations of k (1  $\le$  k  $\le$  n) positive numbers in the favorite list so that P is divisible by 9.  


\\   Your task is writing a program to help find P the password for Bom’s email.  


\\   Input   
\\   The first line contains a positive integer T as the number of test cases in the input file. The   
\\   following lines describe information of each test case including:   
\\   • One line containing two positive integers n and k,   
\\   • n following lines are n favorite numbers.  


\\   Output   
\\   The output file contains T lines; each line is the solution of the corresponding test case that is   
\\   either password P or -1 in case of not finding a feasible number.  


\\   Limits   
\\   T  $\le$  30   
\\   1  $\le$  k  $\le$  n  $\le$  100   
\\   1  $\le$  all favorite numbers  $\le$  10\textasciicircum6
