We call:
F1(x,y) is x*y.

F2(x,y) is x/y if x/y is an integer, else it is 1.

F3(x,y) is the max number k that x/k,y/k are integer.

F4(x,y) is the min number k that more than 0 and k/x,k/y are integer.

For S is an array of integer. First, all of them are one. We have Q query that one forms of:

1 x y k: Change a[x] become Fk(a[x],y).

2 x y k: Change a[x] become Fk(a[x],a[y]).

3 x y: Let 4 number: F1(a[x],a[y]); F2(a[x],a[y]); F3(a[x],a[y]); F4(a[x],a[y]).

Input:

The first line: Two integer,n is the size of S and number Q.

One of Q line next is a query.

Output:

Many line, one of them is result of a query that type 3.

Example:Input:

2 4

1 2 100 1

3 1 2

1 2 1000 2

3 1 2

Output:

100 1 1 100

1 1 1 1

Note:

0$<$n,Q$<$10001;

In the query of type 1: 0$<$x$<$n+1; 0$<$k$<$5; 0$<$y$<$10001.

In the query of type 2: 0$<$x,y$<$n+1; 0$<$k$<$5.

In the query of type 3: 0$<$x,y$<$n+1.\end{verbatim}
