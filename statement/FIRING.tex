About N birds in a row, each bird i-th has power a[i]. If we shoot bird i-th, bird (i-1)-th, bird i-th and bird (i+1)-th will fight, so we lost a[i-1]+a[i]+a[i+1] energy (that a[0]=0, a[n+1]=0). And then, bird i+1 will stand near bird i-1.

John will shoot the bird in descending order of power. If at the time, we have many birds that power is maximum, Jonh'll shoot the bird i-th such that i is smallest possible. Let me know total energy John lost to shoot all bird.

\subsubsection{Input}

The first line is a integer: N. (1≤N≤1000000).

The next line is N integer: a[1],a[2],...,a[n]. (1≤a[i]≤1000000000).

\subsubsection{Output}

Only integer: Result.
