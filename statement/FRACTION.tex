You are given a positive integer N. Let us consider set A of fractions x/y where 0 $<$= x/y $<$= 1, y $<$= N and the maximum common divisor of x and y is 1. 

 For example N = 5. Set A in increasing order consists of elements 0/1; 1/5; 1/4; 1/3; 2/5; 1/2; 3/5; 2/3; 3/4; 4/5; 1/1.

 Your task is to find the i-th smallest fraction in set A.

\subsubsection{Input}

The first line of input contains the number of testcases t (t $<$= 15). The first line of each testcase contains numbers N and M (N $<$= 5000, M $<$= 10000). The next M lines contain one question each. 

\subsubsection{Output}

For each testcase, you should output M lines which are the answers to the M questions. 

\subsubsection{Example}
