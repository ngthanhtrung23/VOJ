     Given a sequence of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000) integers S1, ..., SN (0 ≤ Si $<$ 1,000,000,000), compute the number of distinct increasing subsequences of S with length K (1 ≤ K ≤ 50 and K ≤ N).       Input       The first line contains the two integers N and K. The following N lines contain the integers of the sequence in order.       Output       Print a single integer representing the number of distinct increasing subsequences of S of length K, modulo 5,000,000.       Example       Input:       4 3       1       2       2       10       Output:       1       The only increasing subsequence of length 3 is 1, 2, 10
