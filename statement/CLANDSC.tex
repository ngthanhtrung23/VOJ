Farmer John is building a nicely-landscaped garden, and needs to move a large amount of dirt in the process.

The garden consists of a sequence of N flowerbeds (1 $<$= N $<$= 100), where flowerbed i initially contains A\_i units of dirt.  Farmer John would like to re-landscape the garden so that each flowerbed i instead contains B\_i units of dirt.  The A\_i's and B\_i's are all integers in the range 0..10.

To landscape the garden, Farmer John has several options: he can purchase one unit of dirt and place it in a flowerbed of his choice for \$X.  He can remove one unit of dirt from a flowerbed of his choice and have it shipped away for \$Y.  He can also transport one unit of dirt from flowerbed i to flowerbed j at a cost of \$Z times |i-j|.  Please compute the minimum total cost for Farmer John to complete his landscaping project.

\subsubsection{Input}

* Line 1: Space-separated integers N, X, Y, and Z (0 $<$= X, Y, Z $<$=         1000).

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the space-separated integers A\_i and         B\_i.

\subsubsection{Output}

* Line 1: A single integer giving the minimum cost for Farmer John's         landscaping project.

There are 4 flowerbeds in a row, initially with 1, 2, 3, and 4 units of dirt. \end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
Farmer John wishes to transform them so they have 4, 3, 2, and 0 units of \end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
100, 200, and 1.\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
One unit of dirt must be removed (from flowerbed #4), at a cost of 200.  The \end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
remaining dirt can be moved at a cost of 10 (3 units from flowerbed #4 to \end{verbatim}

flowerbed #1, 1 unit from flowerbed #3 to flowerbed #2).\end{verbatim}
