Given two positive integers, a and b. You have to concatenate all the integers from a to b (inclusive) to form a very, very large number. Calculate this number modulo p.

Constraint: 1 $<$= a $<$= b $<$= 10\textasciicircum18. 
                 1 $<$= p $<$= 10\textasciicircum9.

\subsubsection{Input}

There are multiple test cases. 
 Each test case consists of a single line containing the three intergers - a, b and p, listed in this order.
 Input is terminated by EOF (End of File).

\subsubsection{Output}

For each test case, output one line - the answer.

\subsubsection{Example}
\begin{verbatim}
\textbf{Input:}
1 9 17
9 12 23

\textbf{Output:}
1
12
\end{verbatim}
