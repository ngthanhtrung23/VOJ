In Hanoi, there are N beauty-spots (2 $<$= N $<$= 200), connected by M one-way streets. The length of each street does not exceed 10000. You are the director of a travel agency, and you want to create some tours around the city which satisfy the following conditions:

 
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Each of the N beauty-spots belongs to exactly one tour.

 
	\item  Each tour is a cycle which consists of at least 2 places and visits each place once (except for the place we start from which is visited twice). 

 
	\item  The total length of all the streets we use is minimal.

 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Input}

The first line of input contains the number of testcases t (t $<$= 15). The first line of each testcase contains the numbers N, M. The next M lines contain three integers U V W which mean that there is one street from U to V of length W. 

 

\subsubsection{Output}

For each test case you shold output the minimal total length of all tours.

\textbf{Detailed explanation:}

Test 1:

  Tour #1:  1 - 2 - 3 - 1  --> Length = 20

  Tour #2:  6 - 5 - 4 - 6  --> Length = 22



Test 2:

  Tour #1:  1 - 3 - 2 - 1  --> Length = 27

  Tour #2:  5 - 4 - 5      --> Length = 13
