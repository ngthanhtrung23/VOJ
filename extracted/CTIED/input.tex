* Line 1: Four space-separated integers: N, M, bx, by.

* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the space-separated x and y         coordinates of fence post i.

* Lines 2+N..2+N+M: Each of these M+1 lines contains, in sequence, the         space-separated x and y coordinates of a point along the rope.         The first and last points are always the same as Bessie's         location (bx, by).
