First line contains   \textbf{    T   }   (T $<$ 100), the number of test cases.   \textbf{    T   }   lines follow, each containing the string corresponding to that particular test case.  

\textbf{    Note:   }

   There might be a new-line character (i.e. '$\backslash$r' in C++) at the end of each line. Be careful with your languages.
