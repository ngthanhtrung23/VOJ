Input consists of several test cases. Each case is specified on H + 1 lines. The first line specifies three non negative integers specifying the width W , the height H of the blurred image and the blurring distance D respectively where (1 ≤ W, H ≤ 10) and (D ≤ min(W/2, H/2)). The remaining H lines specify the gray-level of each pixel in the blurred image. Each line specifies W non-negative real numbers given up to the 2nd decimal place. The value of all the given real numbers will be less than 100. Zero or more lines (made entirely of white spaces) may appear between cases. The last line of the input file consists of three zeros.
