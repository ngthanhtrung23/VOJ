For each test case, print a W × H matrix of real numbers specifying the deblurred version of the image. Each element in the matrix should be approximated to 2 decimal places and right justified in a field of width 8. Separate the output of each two consecutive test cases by an empty line. Do not print an empty line after the last test case. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one unique solution for every test case.
