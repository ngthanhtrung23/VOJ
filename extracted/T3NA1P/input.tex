The 3n + 1 problem

The input will consist of a series of pairs of integers i and  j, one pair of integers per line. All integers will be less than  1,000,000 and greater than 0.

You should process all pairs of integers and for each pair determine the maximum cycle length over all integers between and including i and  j.

You can assume that no operation overflows a 32-bit integer.
