In Hanoi, there are N beauty-spots (2 $<$= N $<$= 200), connected by M one-way streets. The length of each street does not exceed 10000. You are the director of a travel agency, and you want to create some tours around the city which satisfy the following conditions:

 
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Each of the N beauty-spots belongs to exactly one tour.

 
	\item  Each tour is a cycle which consists of at least 2 places and visits each place once (except for the place we start from which is visited twice). 

 
	\item  The total length of all the streets we use is minimal.

 
\end{itemize}
