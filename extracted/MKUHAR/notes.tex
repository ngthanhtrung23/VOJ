In the first example, for 99 dollars Lisa will buy three smaller and one larger package of the first ingredient, as well as one smaller and two larger packages of the second ingredient (3x10 + 1x11 + 1x10 + 2x24 = 99).

The chef will then have 51 units (8 + 3x10 + 1x13) of the first ingredient and 60 units (20 + 1x6 + 2x17) of the second ingredient, enough for 5 servings.
