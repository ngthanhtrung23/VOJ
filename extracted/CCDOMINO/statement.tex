Dominoes are gaming pieces used in numerous tile games. Each doimno piece contains two marks. Each mark consists of a number of spots (possibly zero). The number of spots depends on the set size. Each mark in a size \textbf{N} domino set can contain between 0 and \textbf{N} spots, inclusive. Two tiles are considered identical if their marks have the same number of spots, irregardles of reading order. For example tile with 2 and 8 spot marks is identical to the tile having 8 and 2 spot marks. A proper domino set contains no duplicate tiles. A \textbf{complete }set of size\textbf{ N} contains all posible tiles with \textbf{N} or less spots and no duplicate tiles. For example, the complete set of size 2 contains 6 tiles:
