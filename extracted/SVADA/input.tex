The first line contains the integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1 000 000 000), the total time that monkeys spent in the garden, in seconds.  

   The next line contains the integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), the number of monkeys of the first type.  

   Each of the following N lines contains two integers Ak and Bk (1 ≤ Ak, Bk ≤ 1 000 000 000), how fast monkey k of the first type is.  

   The next line contains the integer M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100), the number of monkeys of the second type.  

   Each of the following M lines contains two integers Ck and Dk (1 ≤ Ck, Dk ≤ 1 000 000 000), how fast monkey k of the second type is.
