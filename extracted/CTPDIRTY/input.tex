The first input line contains a positive integer, n, indicating the number of eating scenarios to 

analyze.  The next n lines contain the description of the plates.  Each line contains three integers, 

c, s, and d, (0 ≤ c ≤ 100; 0 ≤ s ≤ 100; 0 ≤ d ≤ 100) representing (respectively) the number of 

plates with both sides clean, the number of plates with one side clean and the number of 

completely dirty plates.
