\textbf{    Explanation   }

   There are 6 cows: 3 accordionists and 3 banjoists. The accordionists have talent levels (1, 1, 5), and the banjoists have talent levels (5, 1, 1).  

   FJ pairs accordionist 3 with banjoist 1 to get earn A   $_    3   $   * B   $_    1   $   = 5 * 5 = 25 in profit.  He loses a total of (1 + 1)   $^    2   $   + (1 + 1)   $^    2   $   = 8 dollars due to the cost of soda for his remaining cows. Thus his final (net) profit is 25 - 8 = 17.
