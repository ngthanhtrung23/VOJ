First line contains two integers N and C (3 ≤ N ≤ 300000, 1 ≤ C ≤ 100000) number of dwarfs and number of colors.  

   Second line contains N integers between 1 and C (inclusive), colors of dwarves hats, ordered the way they formed the line that morning.  

   Third line contains M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100000), number of pictures.  

   Next M lines contain two integers A and B (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ N). Each line describes one picture. On it there are all dwarves starting from A-th all the way to the B-th.
