Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. Each test case is specified using 2N +1 lines.
\\The first line specifies (1 ≤ N ≤ 15) which is the number of knights (or targets.) The following N lines each specifies the position of a knight by specifying two integers representing the x and y location. The remaining N lines each specifies the position of a target square again by specifying two integers representing the x and y location. All coordinates are 32-bit signed integers.
\\The last case is followed by a line with a single zero.
