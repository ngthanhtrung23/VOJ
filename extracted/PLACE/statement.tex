Mirko loves cars and he finally managed to start his own car factory! Factory has N employees, each of them has exactly one superior (except Mirko - he is by default everybody's superior). Mirko is denoted by number 1, and the rest of the employees with numbers 2 to N.




Every employee can raise or lower the wages of all of his subordinates (both direct subordinates and those lower in the hieararchy tree). Mirko‟s role is to prevent abuse of such power, so from time to time he wants to know wage of a particular employee.


He is asking you to write a program which will help him monitor wage changes, given a sequence of commands described in the input section.

Remark: at any time, all of the wages will be positive integers and will fit in standard 32-bit integer type (int in C/C++, longint in Pascal).
