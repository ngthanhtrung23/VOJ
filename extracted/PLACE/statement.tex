Mirko loves cars and he finally managed to start his own car factory! Factory has N employees, each of them has exactly one superior (except Mirko - he is by default everybody's superior). Mirko is denoted by number 1, and the rest of the employees with numbers 2 to N.


\\Every employee can raise or lower the wages of all of his subordinates (both direct subordinates and those lower in the hieararchy tree). Mirkoâ€Ÿs role is to prevent abuse of such power, so from time to time he wants to know wage of a particular employee.
\\He is asking you to write a program which will help him monitor wage changes, given a sequence of commands described in the input section.

Remark: at any time, all of the wages will be positive integers and will fit in standard 32-bit integer type (int in C/C++, longint in Pascal).
