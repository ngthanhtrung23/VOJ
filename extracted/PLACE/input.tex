First line of input contains two space-separated positive integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500 000), number of employees, and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 500 000), number of wage changes and wage queries.


\\Next N lines contain the information about employees 1, 2, ..., N (respectively): starting wage and the identifier of his direct supervisor. Remark: Mirko has no supervisor, so his line will contain only his starting wage.
