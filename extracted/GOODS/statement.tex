When writing out the characters from position to position i of the string S j (1 $<$= i $<$= j $<$= Length (S)) we obtain the sequence S (i, j).

The definition of beauty quotes sequence:

Empty string is a series of beautiful quotes.

If X is a series of beautiful quotes, then [X], (X), \{X\} is also a beautiful array brackets.

If X, Y ranges are 2 beautiful quotation marks, the sequence XY is also beautiful.

Example: () [() ()] is a row of beautiful quotes. \{[)\} Is not beautiful array brackets.

Given a string S contains only the brackets. When writing out the characters from position to position i of the string S j (1 $<$= i $<$= j $<$= Length (S)) we obtain the sequence S (i, j). An S (i, j) is good substring of string S if S (i, j) is a series of beautiful quotes. Request the number of good substring of S.
