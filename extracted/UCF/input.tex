The first input line contains a positive integer, n, indicating the number of restructurings to 

perform.  Each restructuring will contain multiple lines. The first line contains two integers,

b (1 ≤ b ≤ 500) and c (1 ≤ c ≤ 2000), representing (respectively) the number of buildings and the 

number of connections between them.  The next line contains b integers, wi (1 ≤ wi ≤ 500), 

representing the cost of performing a reconstruction on the i-th selected building.  The next c lines 

each contain two integers, xi and yi (1 ≤ xi ≤ b, 1 ≤  yi ≤ b, xi ≠ yi), representing two identifiers for buildings that connect.  There will be at most one direct connection between any two buildings.

Also, every pair of buildings will be directly or indirectly connected.
