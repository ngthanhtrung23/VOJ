\\In this example, the road contains three segments (40 miles at 75 miles per hour, followed by 50 miles at 35 miles per hour, then 10 miles at 45 miles per hour). 
\\Bessie drives for three segments (40 miles at 76 miles per hour, 20 miles at 30 miles per hour, and 40 miles at 40 miles per hour).  During her first segment,
\\she is slightly over the speed limit, but her last segment is the worst infraction, during part of which she is 5 miles per hour over the speed limit.
\\The correct answer is therefore 5.
