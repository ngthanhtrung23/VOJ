Farmer John is building a nicely-landscaped garden, and needs to move a large amount of dirt in the process.

The garden consists of a sequence of N flowerbeds (1 $<$= N $<$= 100), where flowerbed i initially contains A\_i units of dirt.  Farmer John would like to re-landscape the garden so that each flowerbed i instead contains B\_i units of dirt.  The A\_i's and B\_i's are all integers in the range 0..10.

To landscape the garden, Farmer John has several options: he can purchase one unit of dirt and place it in a flowerbed of his choice for \$X.  He can remove one unit of dirt from a flowerbed of his choice and have it shipped away for \$Y.  He can also transport one unit of dirt from flowerbed i to flowerbed j at a cost of \$Z times |i-j|.  Please compute the minimum total cost for Farmer John to complete his landscaping project.
