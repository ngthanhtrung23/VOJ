Input
The first line contains two integers R and C (1 ≤ R, C ≤ 100), the dimensions of the cave.  

   Each of the following R lines will contain C characters. The character '.' represents an empty cell, while the letter 'x' represents a chunk of mineral.  

   The next line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), the number of sticks thrown.  

   The last line contains N integers separated by spaces, the heights at which sticks were thrown. All heights will be between 1 and R (inclusive), with height 1 being the bottom of the matrix and height R the top. The first tick is thrown left to right, the second right to left and so on.  

   No cluster will initially float in the air. Also, the input data will be such that at no point will two or more clusters fall simultaneously, so that there will be no ambiguous situations.
